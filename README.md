# printLe
PrintLe is a web application designed to remotely manage and send print jobs to a network IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) printer via an intermediary Node.js server. This allows for advanced print options like custom page ranges and manual double-sided printing, even if the user is on a mobile device or the printer lacks software support.
